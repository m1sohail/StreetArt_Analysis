# Street Art Analysis 

## Overview 

Across all industries, social media is becoming an increasingly important tool for brands to monitor and leverage. Street art is an industry where social media is particularly important - artists and influencers are able to post images of exceptional street art to expand their audience and potentially launch their career as an artist. In this project, we leveraged Instagram posts and comments regarding street art to build an interactive dashboard which aggregates much of the useful insights available on Instagram. The aim of this dashboard is to pool information about popular artists, locations, murals, and topics to allow parties interested in street art to make more informed decisions about the industry (like what to create next and where, among other things). We begin our analysis by gathering the pertinent information from Instagram, then we analyze captions and comments, use the Google Vision API to derive insights on the post images, to then use a geoparser allowing us to flag locations referenced in posts, and finally aggregate our findings in a user-friendly dashboard. While such pricipals are leveraged to understand street art in this project, such analysis can be up-scaled to any other subject or even be leveraged by brands and companies to gain insights on what the common user thinks of their products.
